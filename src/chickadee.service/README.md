How to do a .NET Core Worker Service in F#

In .NET Core 3 a new type of application called `Worker Service`. 

See also [Host ASP.NET Core in a Windows Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/windows-service?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=netcore-cli)

> The ASP.NET Core Worker Service template provides a starting point for writing long running service apps

The `dotnet` template is only available in C#, so I tried to make it work with F#. This is my first attempt. 

## Run me

1. Clone me
2. `cd` into the folder that was created
3. `dotnet run`

> Hello World

## Suggestions and improvements welcome!
