# All About APRS

APRS stands for Automatic Packet Reporting System. It is a digital-mode packet-radio protocol. Basically this means that you transmit encoded data and it sounds like scratchy modem-noises. 

APRS is often thought of that system where you can transmit your GPS coordinates and you'll show up on a map. While this is true, and often how APRS is used, there are many, many more possibilities. So many that it gave me an idea for an APRS software application, which took me down the rabbit hole of everything APRS and amateur packet radio. 

I will cover everything I learned along the way of developing my own APRS software application, and how anyone, even non-programmers, can get involved in the project.


## Quick definition of APRS

APRS was developed by `Bob Bruninga, WB4APR`. You can find everything APRS on Bob's website, [here](http://www.aprs.org/), and you can find the APRS specification [here](http://www.aprs.org/aprs12.html)

APRS is a system for real-time digital communications of information of immediate value in the local area. 

APRS does this through two main aspects.

* How to propagate data through a distributed, ad-hoc network of radio stations
* Data formats

## Digital packet radio

APRS lives in the world of digital packet radio. This means your data 

### Data propagation

> How data gets around and what that data looks like

APRS aims to share data as far and wide as possible while avoiding network congestion and collisions (radios transmitting over each other). 

How does it do that?
